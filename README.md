# Pong

## Summary
This is an interpretation of the classic arcade game, Pong. The game allows for two players, where each palyer controls one paddle and tries to hit it back and forth. The twist to this version of the game is that if the player scores, their paddle gets smaller as a way to power boost the opponent. After a point is scored, the ball speeds increases slightly to increase the urgency of the game. Lastly, once three points are scored, two balls enter the play field at once. The game ends once a player reaches 6 points. 

The primary languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavsScript as part of our assignment for PerScholas Software Engineering program. Flex display was used as it was part of the assignment, and the best option for the assignment with my current tool set. Additionally, canvas was used as it is an excellent tool for creating these styles of games.

Some challenges faced when creating the program were, but not limited to: increasing the number of balls indefinitely, using objects to do so, storing the balls in an array to make the code cleaner and more readable. I hope in the near future to improve the game and smooth out the code.

## How to Set Up
To run the game, you'll need a modern web browser that can run HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Files Included
1. 'index.html' - Contains the HTML
2. 'style.css' - Contains the style
3. 'script.js' - Contains the logic for the game, and creates the play field.

### Running the Game
1. Clone or  download the repository. 

2. Open the file 'index.html' in a capable web browser.

## How to Play the Game
- The game begins immediately upon loading.
- The left paddle can be controlled up and down using the keys 'w' and 's', respectively. 
- The right paddle can be controlled up and down using the keys 'up arrow' and 'down arrow', respectively.
- The objective of the game is to not let the ball hit your side of the wall. The paddle will redirect the ball.
- If the ball hits your side of the wall, the opponent gets a point.
- If a player scores a point their paddle becomes slightly smaller.
- Anytime a player scores a point, the ball moves slightly faster next round. 
- Once either player hits 3 points, two balls are now put into play.
- The first person to 6 points wins.
